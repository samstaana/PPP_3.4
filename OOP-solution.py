How does this solution demonstrate the four pillars of OOP? (It may not demonstrate all of them, describe only those that apply)
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism

Would it have been easier to implement a solution to this problem using a different coding style? Why or why not?

How in particular did Object Oriented Programming assist in the solving of this problem?
